    <h1>Accumulation Calculator</h1>
    <p>This tab allows you to find how much of a medication a patient has accumulated based on given previous fill dates and days supply dispensed.</p>
    <p>This works well for seeing if a patient has filled enough sequential fills early that they have amassed a stockpile.</p>
    <p>Click "Add Entry" to add as many fill dates needed and input the fill dates and days supply dispensed.</p>
    <p>The entries do not need to be in date-order.</p>
    <p>Press calculate to see the amount accumulated.</p>
