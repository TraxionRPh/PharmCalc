    <h1>Drop Days Supply Calculator</h1>
    <p>This tab allows you to quickly calculate the days supply for eye and ear drops.</p>
    <p>This works well for when the days supply does not auto populate and when verifying that days supply was calculated correctly.</p>
    <p>Put in the total quantity, the drops per dose, and the amount of doses per day, as well as if it is the right, left, or both eyes/ears.</p>
    <p>Press calculate to see the calculated days supply.</p>
